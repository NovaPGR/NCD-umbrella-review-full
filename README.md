## Data Extraction Forms
All 3 data extraction forms are based off the same format. The data extraction tables are marked as Extraction (i.e. `CV extraction`). Each collumn is one of the reviews, with the header being the citation key for Zotero followed by the short form author designation. For each there are 23 pieces of information to be extracted and the questions are included as the second collumn, with the first being its number. 

Each category has any accompanying data tables included in it's respective tab marked table (i.e. data tables for papers in the Misc extraction sheet will be included within `Misc tables`). These are non-uniform and formatted in the most appropriate way for each table. Each table is titled with the Zotero citation key in order to denote which paper it belongs to.
